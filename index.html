                            <p>Hove War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located
                                on Grand Avenue in Hove, part of the city of Brighton and Hove, on the south coast of
                                England. Hove was the site of one of the earliest recruiting events at the beginning of
                                the war and later of several military hospitals. Over 600 men from the town were killed
                                during the war. A war memorial committee was established in 1919 and Lutyens was engaged
                                as architect. He designed a Tuscan column on a three-staged base, topped with a statue
                                of Saint George, patron saint of England. George, cast in the studio of Sir George
                                Frampton, holds a sword by the blade in one hand and a shield in the other. The same
                                statue, with variations, appears on several other monuments. The base contains several
                                dedicatory inscriptions but no names, which are instead recorded on plaques in the
                                town's library. The memorial was unveiled on 27 February 1921 by Lord Leconfield. It is
                                a Grade II listed building.</p>
